# AI Assignment 01 - Kids in the Yard

COMPARISON

-   I used ChatGPT to review my breakdow of the assigment and my choices in seperating the concerns.
    I decided to make three different files, as advised by the spec: Person.py, PersonFactory and 
    FamilyTree.py. 

-   Here are my prompts to the LLM: 
    - Is gender_name_probability.csv supposed to be used in my implementation of 
    FamilyTree.py or can I disregard it? 
    - Is it more efficient to use a dictionary or a list of tuples in PersonFactory 
    to store the CSV data? 

-   The LLM's suggestions were a little over-engineered for the purpose of this
    assignment, but it was good at helping me break down key ideas and 
    steps to take in order to store the data efficiently.  

-   The changes that I considered were for example moving my main.py program into my 
    driver (FamilyTree.py), so that I'm running the full program from FamilyTree 
    directly. 

-   The changes that I refused to make were for example, adding unecessary attributes 
    which aren't needed for the functionality of the program, and aren't mentioned in
    the spec requirements.
